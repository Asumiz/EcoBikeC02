Detailed project presentation

Bicycle Location:

The headquarters of the ecological bicycle company, "EcoBike", is strategically located in the heart of the city of São Paulo. Located in the center of the metropolis, this privileged location offers easy access for both the company's employees and customers interested in purchasing the brand's sustainable bicycles.

In addition to serving as a meeting point for the EcoBike team, the headquarters plays a key role in the production and distribution of bicycles. It is in this space that the meticulous assembly of each bicycle takes place, ensuring high standards of quality and performance. Attention to detail and commitment to sustainability are essential pillars in the production process.

The central location also contributes to EcoBike’s logistical efficiency. From the headquarters, the bicycles are strategically distributed to different regions of the city and surrounding areas, promoting sustainable mobility and providing an ecological transport alternative for residents.

"EcoBike" not only offers a product that promotes a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, but also incorporates these values into its own operation, starting with its headquarters location in downtown São Paulo, where bicycles are carefully assembled and distributed to contribute with a more ecological and conscious future.
