# EcoBikeC02
A course completion project, to complete the course at my disciplinary institution  The project is a way we think to reduce impacts on the environment and increase the health of the population by encouraging physical exercise. Our project is based on renting bicycles to the population and companies for quick delivery, thus reducing co2.
